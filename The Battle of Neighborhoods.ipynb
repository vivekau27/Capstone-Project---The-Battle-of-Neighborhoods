We will take the New York City and the city of Toronto along with city of London. We will segment and cluster their neighborhoods. All cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the three cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are."
